C - this block holds the parameter info for the dynamic lists
C
      INTEGER SIZNOD, NXTNOD, LSTNOD, SIZBIG, NXTBIG, LSTBIG
C
      PARAMETER( SIZNOD = 17, NXTNOD = 5, LSTNOD = 4,

C - current map of edge block is as follows:
C
C  1,2: node pointers for this edge
C  3: not used (set to zero when edge is created)
C  4: flags (see setflg.f)
C  5: pointer to previous edge in list
C  6: pointer to next edge in list
C  7: not used (set to zero when edge is created)
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C - current map of element blocks is as follows:
C
C First block:
C
C  1,2,3: first three connected element pointers for this element
C  4: final connected element pointer, but times two plus one
C  5: pointer to previous block in list (last block for previous element)
C  6: pointer on to second block for this element
C  7: in-sphere radius times ten thousand as an integer
C
C Second block:
C
C  1,2,3,4: first four edges for this element
C  5: pointer back to first block for this element
C  6: pointer on to third block for this element
C  7: sum of edge functionals times ten thousand (as int) for edges of this element
C
C Third block:
C
C  1,2: fifth and sixth edges for this element
C  3: not used (set to zero when element is created)
C  4: flags (see setflg.f)
C  5: pointer back to second block for this element
C  6: pointer to next block in list  (first block for next element)
C  7: element region/material distinguishing value
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C - current map of node block is as follows:
C
C  1,2,3: X,Y,Z co-ordinates
C  4: pointer to previous node in list
C  5: pointer to next node in list
C  6: flags (see stndfl.f)
C  7-15: nodal metric
C  16: element number from original mesh (before adapting) that contains this node
C  17: reserved for node number when creating fixed mesh
