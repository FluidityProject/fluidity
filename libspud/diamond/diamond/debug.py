Debugging module. Stores the program debug level and provides debugging output
functions. Only debugging output with level less than or equal to the current
debug level is output. Note that debugging output with level greater than the
current maximum debug level is treated as having a level equal to the current
maximum debug level, and that debugging output with level less than zero is
treated as having a level equal to zero.
