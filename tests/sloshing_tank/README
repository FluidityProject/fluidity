For nicer results you might one to decrease the timestep.

The result shows a phase difference between the analytical solution and the numerical solution exits and grows up with time.
This might be due to the missing viscous stress on the free surface as described in

Computation of free surface flows with a projection FEM in a moving mesh framework, Sylvain Rabier, Marc Medale

But test gave also these relations:
- smaller timesteps improve the results.
- theta=1.0 damps too much, even with tiny timesteps (dt=0.01).
