EDITING MMS_X.flml and MMS_X.geo (copyscript):

These are copied to MMS_A, MMS_B, MMS_C, MMS_D cases by copyscript
DO NOT CHANGE - timestep or references to MMS_X in MMS_X.flml
DO NOT CHANGE - n = XX in MMS_X.geo

DISABLING PARTS OF THE MODEL:

alternative flml files are included in the alternative_flml folder for debugging failures - these include flml files that have prescribed velocity or k-epsilon fields so that the model can be debugged in stages.

additionally, individual source and absorbtion terms can be disabled within the flml.
