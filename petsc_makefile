# little Makefile used to get the required LIBS and include flags 
# out of petsc, using:
#
# make -f petsc_makefile getlinklibs
# make -f petsc_makefile getincludedirs
#
# Before running this makefile you need to have PETSC_DIR set and
# (unless you're using a prefix-installed installation of PETSc)
# PETSC_ARCH
include ${PETSC_DIR}/lib/petsc/conf/variables
include ${PETSC_DIR}/lib/petsc/conf/rules
