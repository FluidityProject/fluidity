Installing H5PartMerge version 0.1 - January 8, 2008

On Unix/Linux and similar systems, you can simply type

    ./configure [--prefix=/path] [other options]
    make check
    make install

and ignore the rest of this document.

If configure does not work on your system and you have a reasonably
up-to-date set of tools, running ./autogen.sh before running ./configure
may fix the problem.  You can also run the individual commands in
autogen.sh with the --force option, if supported by your version of
the tools.
