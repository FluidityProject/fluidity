Output files containing simulation data are managed using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK - please 
refer to the website \url{http://www.vtk.org/}). VTK tools adopts the .vtu file format for 
unstructured grids: for each N dump times, the \texttt{simulationname\_N.vtu} file is created, 
containing the output data of the simulation. This file contains a snapshot of the run at the timestep
immediately proceeding the dump time. For example, if the timestep is set to three seconds, and the
dump period to 10 seconds, the first dump will occur at 12 seconds.

When running a simulation in parallel, the data are stored both in both .vtu and .pvtu files. 
The .vtu files contain each the output data for each partition of the parallelized mesh, with 
the filename \texttt{simulationName\_P\_N.vtu} wheren P is the processor number and N is the 
dump number. The .pvtu files contain the general output data for the whole mesh, with 
numbering is still ordered by dump number.

Visualisation of the .vtu and .pvtu files can be done using paraview 
(\url{http://www.paraview.org/paraviewindex.html}) and/or mayavi (\url{http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/}).

\subsection{Fields}
\label{sect:diagnostics_fields}

\subsubsection{Internal diagnostic fields}\label{sect:Internal_diagnostic_fields}
\fluidity\ has a set of predefined diagnostic fields called internal diagnostic fields. These diagnostic fields can be scalar, vector and tensor fields. Common used internal diagnostic field are the CFLNumber or the Gradient of a specified scalar\_field.


Each internal diagnostic field has a unique identifier and are classified by their field type: \option{scalar\_field}, \option{vector\_field}
or \option{tensor\_field}. To configure a internal diagnostic field, add a new field of the appropriate type and select the identifier. A description of the available diagnostic fields is given below. For example, to add the CFLNumber (which is a \option{scalar\_field}), one would add a new \option{scalar\_field} and select \option{scalar\_field (CFLNumber)}. 

Some internal diagnostics contain a \option{\ldots/diagnostic/field\_name}
attribute defining the field used to compute the diagnostic (for example the
field used to compute a gradient). The internal diagnostics do not have a dependency resolution, that is if this source field is itself a diagnostic
field it may happen that the source field is not computed yet. In such a case, one should try and use diagnostic algorithms instead, see next section.

In the following, a description of the internal diagnostics available in \fluidity\ is given. 

Internal \option{scalar\_field} diagnostics:

\begin{description}
\item[AbsoluteDifference:]Absolute Difference between two scalar fields. Both fields and this diagnostic \option{scalar\_field} must be in the same \option{material\_phase}. It also assumes both fields are on the same mesh as the AbsoluteDifference field.  
\item[BackgroundPotentialEnergyDensity:]Background potential energy density: $PE_b = \rho z_{star}$ where $\rho$ is the density, $z_{star}$ is the isopycnal coordinate (which is calculated in the diagnostic \option{scalar\_field::IsopycnalCoordinate}. \\Limitations: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Requires a constant gravity direction. 
	\item The Density and GravitationalPotentialEnergyDensity fields must be on the same mesh. 
	\end{itemize}
Limitations: Requires the diagnostic \option{scalar\_field::IsopycnalCoordinate} and (therefore) is not parallelised.
\item[CFLNumber:]CFLNumber as defined on the co-ordinate mesh. It is calculated as $\triangle t \vec{u} \mat{J}^{-1}$ where $\triangle t$ is the timestep, $\vec{u}$ the velocity and $\mat{J}$ the Jacobian. 
\item[ControlVolumeCFLNumber:]CFL Number as defined on a control volume mesh. It is calculated as $\triangle t \frac{1}{V} \int _{cv_{face}} \vec{u}$ where $\triangle t$ is the timestep and $\vec{u}$ the velocity. The integral is taken over the faces of the control volume and $V$ is the volume of the control volume.
\item[***ControlVolumeDivergence:]
\item[DG\_CourantNumber:]CFLNumber as defined on a DG mesh. It is calculated as $\triangle t \frac{1}{V} \int _{element} \vec{u}$ where $\triangle t$ is the timestep and $\vec{u}$ the velocity. The integral is taken over the faces of the element $V$ is the volume of the element.
\item[DiffusiveDissipation:] The rate at which internal energy is converted to potential energy: $-g\ppx[y]{\rho}$, where $\rho$ is the Density. Note the actual diffusive dissipation is $-2g\tensor{\kappa} \ppx[y]{\rho}$ (2 subject to definition) where $\ppt[t]{\rho} + \vec{u}\cdot \nabla \rho = \tensor{\kappa} \nabla^2 \rho$. This should be taken into account when post-processing. It also assumes kappa is isotropic and constant, cf. \cite{winters1995}.
\item[DiscontinuityDetector:]This field detects the discontinuities in a discontinuous Galerkin field, the larger the discontinuity, the larger the value it takes. The discontinuity field is used by the HWENO slope limiter, \ref{sect:ND_hermite_weno_limiter}.
\item[***FiniteElementDivergence:]  
\item[FreeSurfaceHistory:] The free surface history diagnostics saves snapshots of the free surface field. The regularity and amount of snapshots can be specified in diamond. The main usage of this diagnostic is for harmonic analysis, see \ref{sec:diagnostic_algorithms}
\item[FunctionalBegin:]Add a field to be used by Explicit\_ALE to visualize functional values before iterations start.  
\item[FunctionalIter:]Add a field to be used by Explicit\_ALE to visualize functional values at each iteration.

\item[GridReynoldsNumber:]Grid Reynolds number: $Re = U\Delta x/\nu$, where $\nu$ is the viscosity. It is calculated as $\tensor{\nu}^{-1}\vec{u}\mat{J}$ where $\tensor{\nu}$ is the viscosity tensor, $\vec{u}$ the velocity and $\mat{J}$ the Jacobian.
\item[***HarmonicPhaseSSa:]
\item[HorizontalStreamFunction:]Calculate the horizontal stream function psi where:  $\ppx[]{\psi} = -v$ and  $\ppx[y]{\psi}  = u$ where $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components perpendicular to the gravity direction. A strong Dirichlet boundary condition of $0$ is applied on all boundaries.  
\item[HorizontalVelocityDivergence:]Horizontal velocity divergence: ${div}_H \vec{u}$. The horizontal plane is determined from the gravity field direction.

	\item Not parallelised
	\end{itemize} 
\item[KineticEnergyDensity:]Kinetic energy density: $\frac{1}{2} \rho |\vec{u}|^2$ where $\rho$ is the density taken from the \option{scalar\_field::Density}. \\

\end{description}


\subsubsection{Diagnostic algorithms}\label{sec:diagnostic_algorithms}

The name of each field for each material / phase  in the options tree must be
unique. Hence there can only be one field named ``Gradient'' in a single
material /phase. The concept of a diagnostic algorithm is designed to solve this
issue - multiple fields, each with their own name, can share the same algorithm.
This, for example, allows the gradient of multiple fields to be calculated for a
single material / phase.

To configure a diagnostic field using a diagnostic algorithm, select the
\option{\ldots/diagnostic} option for a generic \option{scalar\_field}, \option{vector\_field}
or \option{tensor\_field}. This contains a \option{\ldots/diagnostic/algorithm}
choice element from which you can select the diagnostic algorithm.

Some diagnostic algorithms contain a \option{\ldots/diagnostic/algorithm/source\_field}
attribute defining the field used to compute the diagnostic (for example the
field used to compute a gradient). If this source field is itself a diagnostic
field defined in terms of a diagnostic algorithm then the source field is
computed first (dependency resolution).
In the majority of cases, a \option{scalar\_source\_field}, \option{vector\_source\_field}, \option{tensor\_source\_field}
or \option{component\_source\_field} attribute is defined. This identifies the
expected type of input field. \option{component\_source\_field} denotes scalar field
input, but for which vector or tensor field components of the form \option{field\_name\%comp}
can be used.
The attribute \option{\ldots/diagnostic/algorithm/material\_phase\_support}, which may take the
value ``single'' or ``multiple'', defines if the diagnostic algorithm may
access fields in other material / phases. For multiple \option{material\_phase\_support}
diagnostic fields, a source field in another material / phase
may be defined by a :: delimited ``state\_name\::field\_name'' string.

           Diamond. Here a pressure gradient diagnostic is defined.}
  \label{fig:diagnostic_algorithm}
\end{figure}

The available internal \option{scalar\_field}  diagnostics are:
\begin{description}
\item[tidal\_harmonics :] Calculates the (tidal) harmonics of the FreeSurface field. Note that "ocean boundaries" (see \ref{sec:ocean_boundaries}) have to be set and the FreeSurface and FreeSurfaceHistory diagnostic field have to be switched on (see \ref{sect:Internal_diagnostic_fields}).  
\item[temporalmin :] Writes the (nodewise) minimum scalar value over all previous timesteps.
\item[temporalmax :] Writes the (nodewise) maximum scalar value over all previous timesteps.
\end{description}        


\subsubsection{Python diagnostic algorithms}

A python diagnostic algorithm, chosen via \option{\ldots/diagnostic/algorithm::scalar\_python\_diagnostic}
(or similar equivalents for vector and tensor fields) allows direct access to the
internal \fluidity\ data structures in the computation of a diagnostic field. The
python code entered at \option{\ldots/diagnostic/algorithm::scalar\_python\_diagnostic}
can access three variables: the simulation timestep \lstinline[language = Python]*dt*,
the diagnostic field \lstinline[language = Python]*field*, and the simulation state
\lstinline[language = Python]*state*. \lstinline[language = Python]*field* and
\lstinline[language = Python]*state* are python representations of the internal
\fluidity\ data structures - see appendix \ref{chap:python}\ for more
complete documentation of the Python state interface.

\begin{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Python]
deltaT = 4.0

t = state.scalar_fields["Temperature"]
assert(t.node_count == field.node_count)

for i in range(field.node_count):
        tMinusT0 = t.node_val(i) * deltaT
        diagVisc = 1.620e-2 * (1.0 - 2.79e-2 * tMinusT0 + 6.73e-4 * tMinusT0 * tMinusT0)
        visc = numpy.zeros((3, 3))
        for j in range(3):
                visc[j][j] = diagVisc
        field.set(i, visc)
\end{lstlisting}

         viscosity used in a baroclinic annulus simulation, configured
         as in \citet{hignett1985} table 1 (main comparison).}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Other diagnostic algorithms}

\option{scalar\_field} diagnostic algorithms:

\begin{description}
\item[extract\_scalar\_component:] Extracts a Cartesian component of a
  named vector field (see attributes). Element \option{component} sets 
  which Cartesian component is extracted.
\end{description}

%---------------------OFFLINE DIAGNOSTICS-------------------------%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Offline diagnostics}
\label{sect:offline_diagnostics}

There are three main types of offline diagnostics:
\begin{itemize}
\item fltools, section \ref{sect:fltools}: programs written in fortran that are compiled by running \lstinline[language = XML]+make fltools+ on the command line in the top directory of the \fluidity source tree. The F90 source files can be found in \lstinline[language = XML]+tools+
\item python scripts, section \ref{sect:diagnostics_useful_scripts}: scripts that can be run from the command line. They are found in \lstinline[language = XML]+scripts+
\item python modules: modules that can be imported e.g. for use in a test case. They are found in \lstinline[language = XML]+python/fluidity/diagnostics+ and are imported with  \\ \lstinline[language = python]+import python.fluidity.diagnostics.modulename+
\end{itemize}

\subsection{vtktools}
\label{sect:diagnostics_vtk_tools}

Vtktools allows you to analyse data from the vtu file using python. This includes the values of all the fields at each point at each dump.  Vtktools is documented on the wiki Cook Book.
 

\subsection{Diagnostic output}
\label{sect:diagnostic_output}

\subsection{fltools}
\label{sect:fltools}
An extended set of \fluidity\ tools exist that supplement the main
\fluidity\ program. Table \ref{tab:fltools} lists them and descriptions can
be found by referring to the relevant section. The tools can be built by
running \lstinline[language = bash]+make fltools+ in the top directory of
the \fluidity\ trunk. The programs generated can then be found in the
\lstinline[language = bash]+bin/+ directory.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CREATE CLIMATOLOGY ATLAS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{create\_climatology\_atlas}
\label{sect:create_climatology_atlas}

This creates a climatology atlas, for use with ICOM, using "High resolution ($1/4 ^\circ$) Temperature and Salinity Analyses of the World's Oceans. Version 2"

The $1/4 ^\circ$ grid climatological mean fields of in situ temperature (degrees Celsius) and salinity (practical salinity scale) for the annual, seasonal, and monthly time periods were calculated by \cite{boyer2005} using objective analysis techniques. The data and associated metadata was obtained from the NODC, \url{http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOA01/qd_ts01.html}. All the data files are gzipped ASCII 1/4 gridded data files ('Girdded Fields') and contain the DOS end-of-line character (M). There are 12 monthly averages of temperature and 12 monthly averages of salinity. In addition, there 4 seasonal averages of temperature and 4 seasonal averages of salinity corresponding to winter (defined as January, February and March), spring summer and autumn. Further information can be found online at the above address.

For use with ICOM (relaxing to climatology at the boundaries), a NetCDF data was created containing the monthly means, and the additional 9 standard levels from the seasonal means in order to provide information below the 1500m level. In addition, Killworth correction (Killworth 1995) is applied to the data in order to facilitate accutate time interpolation.

To use this just execute it in the directory which contains all the files listed above gunzipped.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FLADAPT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{fladapt}
\label{sect:fladapt}
fladapt performs a single mesh adapt based on the input options file (which may be a checkpoint) and outputs the resulting mesh. It run from the command line:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
fladapt [-v] INPUT OUTPUT
\end{lstlisting}
where \lstinline[language = Bash]+INPUT+ is the name of the input options file and \lstinline[language = Bash]+OUPUT+ is the name of the generated mesh. The flag \lstinline[language = Bash]+-v+ flag enables verbose output and the flag \lstinline[language = Bash]+-h+ flag displays the help message.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FLDIAGNOSTICS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{fldiagnostics}
\label{sect:fldiagnostics}
fldiagnostics is an offline diagnostic tool. It is run from the command line:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
fldiagnostics ACTION [OPTIONS] INPUT OUTPUT [FIRST] [LAST]
\end{lstlisting}

If \lstinline[language = Bash]+FIRST+ is supplied, treats \lstinline[language = Bash]+INPUT+ and \lstinline[language = Bash]+OUTPUT+ as project names, and processes the specified range of project files. The options are:

              -o NAME   Diagnostic field name
              -r RANK   Specify the rank of the diagnostic field (will try all
                        ranks if not supplied, but will also suppress useful
                        error messages)

              -x FLML   Model options file (not always required)
\end{lstlisting}

and the \lstinline[language = Bash]+-h+ flag displays the help message. To add the diagnostic field GridReynoldsNumber to a set of vtus run:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PETSC READNSOLVE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{petsc\_readnsolve}
\label{sect:petsc_readnsolve} 
Whenever in \fluidity\ a linear solve has not completed succesfully the equation is dumped out in a file called matrixdump. This file can be used to analyse the behaviour of this solve without having to rerun the model with petsc\_readnsolve. It reads in the matrixdump and tries to solve it with PETSc options set in the flml file. It is advisable to first reproduce the failing solve with the same options as it happened in \fluidity\. After that the solver options in the flml file can be changed to see if that fixes the problem. The options under \option{\ldots/solver/diagnostics} are particularly useful to diagnose the problem.  petsc\_readnsolve is run from the command line:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
petsc_readnsolve FILENAME FIELDNAME [OPTIONS]
\end{lstlisting}
where \lstinline[language = Bash]+FILENAME+ is the relevant flml file and \lstinline[language = Bash]+FIELDNAME+ is the field for which the solve was failing. The \lstinline[language = Bash]+OPTIONS+ available are:
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
 -l 	 			Write the information that is normally
				printed  in the terminal to a log file 
				called petsc_readnsolve.log-0.
-prns_verbosity N 	 	Determines the amount of information 
				that is printed to the terminal. By default 
				petsc_readnsolve uses the maximum verbosity 
				(3), this can be lowered with this option. 
-prns_filename file		reads from the specified file instead of 
				'matrixdump'
-prns_zero_init_guess 		no initial guess is read from matrixdump 
				instead the initial guess is zeroed
-prns_write_solution file 	writes solution vector to specified file 
				so that it can be used for comparison in 
				next runs of petsc_readnsolve (provided 
				we are sufficiently confident in the 
				accuracy of the obtained solution).
-prns_read_solution file 	reads solution vector from the specified file,
				so that exact errors can be calculated. For 
				small matrices a good approximation of the  
				exact solution can be found using a direct 
				method: select iterative_method "preonly" 
				and preconditioner "lu" in the .flml. Note 
				however that for ill-conditioned matrices 
				direct methods are very sensitive to round 
				off errors
-prns_scipy 			writes out several files that can be read in scipy.
-prns_random_rhs 	 	Instead of the rhs in the matrixdump, use a 
				random rhs vector.
\end{lstlisting} 

Additionally all options that are available from the PETSc library may be added to the command line. Options specified in the flml file always take precedence however. Some PETSc useful options:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
-ksp_view 	Information on all the solver settings.
-mat_view_info 	Information on matrix size
-mat_view_draw 	Draw the matrix nonzero structure
-help 		Gives an overview of all PETSc options that can be given for 
		the selected solver/preconditioner combination. 
\end{lstlisting} 

{\bf Parallel}


When a solve fails in a parallel run, a single matrixdump file is written. petsc\_readnsolve can be run in serial on this matrixdump but owing to the usual large size of a parallel run and that the behaviour of a solver in parallel is often different than in serial, it is generally better to run petsc\_readnsolve in parallel as well. This is done by prepending \lstinline[language = Bash]+mpirun -np N+ on the command line (where \lstinline[language = Bash]+N+ is the number of processes).

petsc\_readnsolve in parallel requires the mesh files of the same mesh as the one used by \fluidity\ during the failing solve. Therefore, for adaptive runs, a checkpoint at the point of the failing solve is required and then the checkpoint flml is used for petsc\_readnsolve. In most cases the mesh files are not needed for serial runs of petsc\_readnsolve, even if the \fluidity\ run was parallel.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROJECT TO CONTINUOUS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{project\_to\_continuous}
\label{sect:project_to_continuous}
project\_to\_continuous, given a vtu file containing fields on a discontinuous mesh and triangle files for the corresponding continuous mesh, will produce a vtu with its fields projected onto the continuous mesh. It is run from the command line:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
project_to_continuous [OPTIONS] vtufile trianglename
\end{lstlisting}

where \lstinline[language = Bash]+vtufile+ is the name of the discontinuous vtu and \lstinline[language = Bash]+trianglename+ is the base name of the triangle files. The flag \lstinline[language = Bash]+-h+ prints out the help message and the flag \lstinline[language = Bash]+-v+ enables verbose output.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STREAMFUNCTION 2D %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{streamfunction\_2d}
\label{sect:streamfunction_2d}

streamfunction\_2d solves the Poisson equation for the 2D streamfunction $\Psi$:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \Psi = \ppx{u_y} - \ppx[y]{u_x},
\end{equation}

using a continuous Galerkin formulation. It applies the strong Dirichlet
boundary condition of:

\begin{equation}
\Psi = 0 \quad \text{ on } \partial \Omega,
\end{equation}

for all surfaces, and hence is only suitable for problems with a no normal flow boundary
condition on all surfaces.

streamfunction\_2d is built as part of the fltools build target (see section \ref{sect:fltools}),
and is used via:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
streamfunction_2d [-v] input output
\end{lstlisting}

where \lstinline[language = Bash]+input+ is a vtu file containing a continuous vector
field ``Velocity'', and \lstinline[language = Bash]+output+ is an output vtu filename. The
\lstinline[language = Bash]+-v+ flag enables verbose output.

streamfunction\_2d can only be used in serial.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TEST PRESSURE SOLVE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{test\_pressure\_solve}
\label{sect:test_pressure_solve}

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
unifiedmesh <triangle-file-1> <triangle-file-2> <output-file-name>
\end{lstlisting} 
No file names should have extenstions and both the triangle mesh files and the vtu file will have the name \lstinline[language = Bash]+output-file-name+

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% VERTICAL INTEGRATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{vertical\_integration}
\label{sect:vertical_integration}

The vertical\_integration tool computes the Galerkin projection of the vertical
integral of some field onto a specified target surface mesh, via supermeshing (see section \ref{sec:supermeshing})
of the source mesh with a vertical extrusion of the target mesh. This can be used to
compute vertically integrated quantities for arbitrary unstructured meshes (with
no columnar vertical structure).

vertical\_integration is built as part of the fltools build target (see section \ref{sect:fltools}),
and is used via:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
vertical_integration -b bottom -t top -s sizing [-p degree -v]
  target source output
\end{lstlisting}

where \lstinline[language = Bash]+target+ is the target surface mesh triangle base name,
\lstinline[language = Bash]+source+ is the source vtu, and \lstinline[language = Bash]+output+
is an output vtu filename.

The compulsory flags \lstinline[language = Bash]+-b bottom+
and \lstinline[language = Bash]+-t top+ define the lower and upper bounds of
the vertical integral to be \lstinline[language = Bash]+bottom+ and \lstinline[language = Bash]+top+
respectively, and \lstinline[language = Bash]+-s sizing+ sets the thickness of layers
used in the computation of the vertical integral (the thickness of the layers in the
vertical extrusion of the target mesh through the source mesh). The optional
flag \lstinline[language = Bash]+-p degree+ sets the polynomial degree of the
output integral. By default the output field is \Pzero (discontinuous).
If \lstinline[language = Bash]+degree+$> 0$ is specified, then the output
field is \ensuremath{P_{degree}} (continuous). The
\lstinline[language = Bash]+-v+ flag enables verbose output.

vertical\_integration can only be used in serial.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SUPERMESH DIFFERENCE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{supermesh\_difference}
\label{sect:supermesh_difference}

The supermesh\_difference tool computes the difference between two vtu
files using supermesh construction. supermesh\_difference is built as part of
the fltools build target (see section \ref{sect:fltools}), and is used via:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
supermesh_difference vtu_1 vtu_2 output_vtu
\end{lstlisting}

The output vtu (with filename \lstinline[language = Bash]+output_vtu+)
is equal to the first vtu (with filename \lstinline[language = Bash]+vtu_1+)
minus the second vtu (with filename \lstinline[language = Bash]+vtu_2+).  The
\lstinline[language = Bash]+-v+ flag enables verbose output.

Be aware that supermesh\_difference can generate extremely large output files,
particularly in three dimensions. supermesh\_difference can only be used in
serial.

\end{lstlisting} 
with \lstinline[language = Bash]+PROJECT+ the base name of the stat file. The default output is to PROJECT.csv. Running with the option \lstinline[language = Bash]+-h+ will provide further information on the output file name, type and format.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STATPLOT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{statplot}
\label{sect:statplot}

statplot is a graphical program for previewing files in the .stat file format.
statplot can be launched via:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
scripts/statplot filename [filename2 filename3 ...]
\end{lstlisting}

This generates a graphical user interface displaying a plot of one statistic in
the .stat file against another. The ordinate and abscissa statistics can be
selected via combo boxes immediately beneath the plot. The plot itself can
be navigated using the pylab navigation toolbar - see
\url{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/navigation_toolbar.html} for
more complete documentation.

If multiple .stat files are supplied, the data are combined. This is useful for
visualising output for simulations that are checkpointed and resumed.

A mesh.node, mesh.face and mesh.ele file are required. \lstinline[language = Bash]+<transformation>+ is a python expression giving the coordinate transformation. For example to rescale the z-dimension by a factor of 1000 run:
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
scripts/transform_mesh '(x,y,1000*z)' mesh
\end{lstlisting}
It can be used for 2D or 3D meshes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  VTUDECOMP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{vtudecomp}
\label{sect:vtudecomp}

vtudecomp decomposes a vtu given a decomposed triangle mesh. It is run from the command line:
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
scripts/transform_mesh [OPTIONS] MESH VTU
\end{lstlisting}
with \lstinline[language = Bash]+MESH+ the base name of the decomposed triangle mesh and \lstinline[language = Bash]+VTU+ the name of the vtu file to be decomposed. Running with the option \lstinline[language = Bash]+-h+ provides further information on the other options. Note, genpvtu, section \ref{sect:genpvtu} can be used to create a pvtu from the decomposed vtus.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  VTUDIFF %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{vtudiff}
\label{sect:vtudiff}

vtudiff generates vtus with fields equal to the difference between the corresponding fields in two input vtus (\lstinline[language = Bash]+INPUT1+ - \lstinline[language = Bash]+INPUT2+). The fields of \lstinline[language = Bash]+INPUT2+ are projected onto the cell points of \lstinline[language = Bash]+INPUT1+. It is run from the command line:
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Bash]
scripts/transform_mesh [OPTIONS] INPUT1 INPUT2 OUTPUT [FIRST] [LAST]
\end{lstlisting}
with \lstinline[language = Bash]+OUTPUT+ the name of the output vtu. If \lstinline[language = Bash]+FIRST+ is supplied, treats INPUT1 and INPUT2 as project names, and generates a different vtu for the specified range of output files \lstinline[language = Bash]+FIRST+ - \lstinline[language = Bash]+LAST+. If not supplied \lstinline[language = Bash]+LAST+ defaults to \lstinline[language = Bash]+FIRST+. The option \lstinline[language = Bash]+-s+ if supplied together with \lstinline[language = Bash]+FIRST+ and \lstinline[language = Bash]+LAST+, only \lstinline[language = Bash]+INPUT1+ is treated as a project name. This allows a range of vtus to be diffed against a single vtu.


\section{The stat file}
\label{sect:diagnostics_stat_file}
\index{stat file}

The stat file contains information about the simulation, collected at run time. These diagnostics can be extracted from it using the stat\_parser, section \ref{sect:diagnostic_output} and it can be quickly and easily visualised with statplot, section \ref{sect:statplot}. Note, for parallel runs, unless otherwise stated the values have been calculated in a `parallel-safe' manner.

The diagnostics that are recorded in the stat file for each field are selected by the user.  What is included should be considered carefully as including a lot of information can make a notable increase in the simulation run time. To configure the stat file locate the \option{\ldots/stat} element for a generic \option{scalar\_field}, \option{vector\_field} or \option{tensor\_field}, e.g. Figure \ref{fig:diamond_enable_stat}. This contains further elements that will allow the configuration of the stat file as outlined in table \ref{tab:stat_file_diagnostics}. Diagnostics that are more involved and require a longer description are listed in table \ref{tab:stat_file_diagnostics} and documented in section \ref{sect:stat_diagnostics}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \fig[width=0.7\textwidth]{visualisation_and_diagnostics_images/diamond_enable_stat}
  \caption{Example configuration of the stat file for \option{\ldots/vector\_field(Velocity)}.}
  \label{fig:diamond_enable_stat}
\end{figure}

The diagnostics will be output at every time step, from the end of the first time step onwards and, where relevant, are output before the mesh is adapted. The following options, regarding when the diagnostics are output, may also be chosen by activating the following elements in the Diamond file (the names are self-explanatory):
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{/io/stat/output\_at\_start}
\item \option{/io/stat/output\_before\_adapts}
\item \option{/io/stat/output\_after\_adapts}
\end{itemize}  

It is also possible to include the values from the previous time step and nonlinear iterations for a vector field by picking the choice elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/stat/previous\_time\_step/include\_in\_stat}
\item \option{\ldots/stat/nonlinear\_field/include\_in\_stat}
\end{itemize}

and for a scalar field by activating the elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/stat/include\_nonlinear\_field}
\item \option{\ldots/stat/include\_previous\_time\_step}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{File format}

There are two file formats used for storing data in .stat files: a plain text format
and a binary format.

\subsubsection{Plain text .stat file format}

A plain text .stat file consists of two sections: an XML header section and a
data section. The header section appears at the start of the .stat file within
\lstinline[language = XML]*<header>* $\ldots$
\lstinline[language = XML]*</header>* tags, and defines all meta data concerning
all statistics contained in the data section. The data section contains a number of lines,
with each line containing a single data point for each of the statistics defined in the header
section.

The header element contains 
\lstinline[language = XML]*<constant>* and
\lstinline[language = XML]*<field>* child elements. The
\lstinline[language = XML]*<constant>* elements contain data relevant to the
entire simulation, such as the \fluidity\ version and simulation start date:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = XML]
  <constant name = "field_name"
    type = "field_type" value = "field_value"/>
\end{lstlisting}

where the \lstinline[language = XML]*type* attribute defines the data type
(one of "string", "integer" or "float"). A plain text .stat file defines one
additional constant element:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = XML]
<constant name="format" type="string" value="plain_text"/>
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstinline[language = XML]*<field>* elements contain meta-data for statistics
contained in the data section:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = XML]
  <field name = "field_name"
    statistic = "statistic_name" column = "field_column"
    [material_phase = "material_phase_name"]
    [components = "field_components"]/>
\end{lstlisting}

For statistics of scalar, vector or tensor fields, 
\lstinline[language = XML]*statistic* defines the statistic name for
a field \lstinline[language = XML]*name* in material / phase
\lstinline[language = XML]*material_phase*. For other objects (such as mesh
statistics) the \lstinline[language = XML]*material_phase* attribute may not
be supplied. The \lstinline[language = XML]*column* attribute is an integer defining the
index of the first component of the field data in each line of the data section.
The optional \lstinline[language = XML]*component* attribute defines the number
of field components (and defaults to one if not supplied). 

\begin{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[language = XML]
<header>
<constant name="FluidityVersion" type="string" value="11780M" />
<constant name="CompileTime" type="string" value="Nov 25 2009 09:38:20" />
<constant name="StartTime" type="string" value="20091125 095448.326+0000" />
<constant name="HostName" type="string" value="Unknown" />
<constant name="format" type="string" value="plain_text" />
<field column="1" name="ElapsedTime" statistic="value"/>
<field column="2" name="dt" statistic="value"/>
<field column="3" name="ElapsedWallTime" statistic="value"/>
<field column="4" name="CoordinateMesh" statistic="nodes"/>
<field column="5" name="CoordinateMesh" statistic="elements"/>
<field column="6" name="CoordinateMesh" statistic="surface_elements"/>
<field column="7" name="Tracer" statistic="min" material_phase="Fluid"/>
<field column="8" name="Tracer" statistic="max" material_phase="Fluid"/>
<field column="9" name="Tracer" statistic="l2norm" material_phase="Fluid"/>
<field column="10" name="Tracer" statistic="integral" material_phase="Fluid"/>
</header>
1.0 1.0 0.108 41 40 2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
2.0 1.0 0.146 41 40 2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{A simple plain text .stat file}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Binary .stat file format}

The binary .stat file format contains an XML header section stored in a plain
text file, and a data section stored in binary in
a separate file. The file name of the binary data file is equal to the
header file name plus an additional \textit{.dat} file extension. The XML
header section is identical to the plain text XML header, except that the
\lstinline[language = XML]*format* constant element is replaced with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = XML]
<constant name="format" type="string" value="binary"/>
\end{lstlisting}

The binary .stat file format also defines two additional constant elements:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = XML]
<constant name="real_size" type="integer" value="real_byte_size"/>
<constant name="integer_size" type="integer" value="integer_byte_size"/>
\end{lstlisting}

defining the size (in bytes) of a real and an integer in the data section.

At present the data section of binary .stat files contains only floating point
data.

\subsection{Reading .stat files in python}
\label{sect:diagnostics_stat_parser}

A .stat file can be read into a dictionary object using the
\lstinline[language = Python]*fluidity_tools* python module via:

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Python]
import fluidity_tools
stat = fluidity_tools.stat_parser(filename)
\end{lstlisting}

\lstinline[language = Python]*fluidity_tools.stat_parser* reads both
plain text and binary .stat file formats. For .stat files using the binary
format, \lstinline[language = Python]*filename* should correspond to the XML
header file.

You can find out which fields are contained in a state Fluid via:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
stat["Fluid"].keys()
\end{lstlisting}

The ``max'' statistics of a field ``Velocity\%magnitude'' in this state can be
plotted via:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from matplotlib import pylab
time = stat["ElapsedTime"]["value"]
max_speed = stat["Fluid"]["Velocity%magnitude"]["max"]
pylab.plot(time, max_speed)
pylab.xlabel("Time")
pylab.ylabel("Max Speed")
pylab.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\label{tab:stat_file_diagnostics}
\end{longtable}
\end{landscape}

\subsubsection{Surface integrals}
\label{sect:stat_surface_integral}

The surface integral diagnostics allow the calculation of surface integrated quantities
for arbitrary scalar or vector fields. The options can be found for any scalar
or vector field at \option{\ldots/stat/surface\_integral}. All surface integral diagnostics are parallelised.

\textbf{Scalar fields}

There are two types of surface integrals for scalar fields, \option{value} and
\option{gradient\_normal}. These are selected in the \option{type} attribute of
\option{\ldots/stat/surface\_integral}.

The surface integral type \option{value} calculates the surface integral of the
scalar field $c$:

\begin{equation}
\int_{\partial \Omega} c,
\end{equation}

and the surface integral type \option{gradient\_normal} calculates surface integral
of the dot product of the gradient of the field with the surface normal:

\begin{equation}
\int_{\partial \Omega} \nabla c \cdot \vec{n}.
\end{equation}

The \option{gradient\_normal} surface integral is calculated using the volume
element shape function derivatives, via:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i,j} \int_{\partial \Omega} {c_i \frac{\partial \phi_i}{\partial x_j} n_j}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Vector fields}

There is one type of surface integral for vector fields, \option{value}. This
calculates the surface integral of the dot product of the field with the surface
normal:

\begin{equation}
\int_{\partial \Omega} \vec{v} \cdot \vec{n}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Surface integral options}

The \option{name} attribute must be set for all diagnostic surface integrals. In
addition to this, surface IDs (see section \ref{sect:surface_ids}) may be specified at
\option{\ldots/stat/surface\_integral/surface\_ids}. If specified, the surface
integral is computed over just these surfaces. If it is disabled the integral is computed
over the whole surface of the
mesh. If the element \option{\ldots/stat/surface\_integral/normalise} is activated
the integral is normalised by dividing by the surface area.

\subsubsection{Mixing stats}
\label{sect:stat_mixing_stats}
Mixing stats calculates the volume fraction of the scalar field in a set of `bins' the bounds of which are specified by the user. 

The mixing stats can be calculated using the control-volume mesh or for \Poo using the mesh that the scalar field is on. This is specified by setting the choice element under \option{\ldots/stat/include\_mixing\_stats[0]} to either \option{continuous\_galerkin} or \option{control\_volumes}. The bin bounds must also be specified.  The element \option{\ldots/stat/include\_mixing\_stats[0]/mixing\_bin\_bounds} requires a list of floats that are the values of the bin bounds e.g. if the list reads 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 then 5 bins will be returned with ($c$: the scalar field):
\begin{itemize}
\item size bin 1 $=$ volume fraction of domain with $0.0\leq c < 1.0$
\item size bin 2 $=$ volume fraction of domain with $1.0\leq c < 2.0$
\item \ldots 
\item size bin 5 $=$ volume fraction of domain with $3.0\leq c$
\end{itemize}

The volume fractions can be normalised by the total volume of the domain by activating the element \option{\ldots/stat/include\_mixing\_stats[0]/control\_volumes/normalise}. The `tolerance' beneath the bin bounds for which the scalar field should be included can be specified by activating the element \option{\ldots/stat/include\_mixing\_stats[0]/control\_volumes/tolerance} (i.e. $1.0-\mathrm{tolerance} \leq c < 2.0-\mathrm{tolerance}$). If not selected it defaults to machine tolerance epsilon(0.0). For an example of using the mixing stats see the test case in the \fluidity\ trunk \lstinline[language = bash]+.../tests/lock_exchange_2d_cg+ or \lstinline[language = bash]+.../tests/cv_mixing_bin_test_serial/+.

\subsection{Detectors}
\label{sect:diagnostics_detectors}
The detectors file contains information about the positions of the detectors which is the same for all time steps in the case of static detectors and change at each time step for the Lagrangian detectors as they are advected by the flow. It also contains information about the values of different flow variables at the positions of the detectors. Both, position and variables information are collected at run time.

The user selects which field variables should be included in the detectors file by setting the corresponding option in Diamond. For example, if interested in the value of Temperature at the different detectors positions and at each time step, the option \option{\ldots/scalar\_field/prognostic/detectors} \option{/include\_in\_detectors} should be set. Only the fields of interest should be included since extra information will make the detectors file very large and more difficult to handle. If many detectors are present and/or information from many flow variables is required, it is recommended to set the \option{/io/detectors/binary\_output} in Diamond, since an ascii file will quickly become very large.

The information of the detectors can be extracted with stat\_parser and it can be visualised with statplot. 

The position of the detectors and value of the selected variables at those positions is saved into the output file at every time step, starting from the end of the first time step and it is done before the mesh is adapted. 

\subsubsection{File format}
\label{sect:detectors_output}
Similarly to the .stat file, the detectors file formats are ascii or plain text format and binary format.

In plain text format, the .detectors file contains first an XML header followed by a section with the data. The header is contained within \lstinline[language = XML]*<header>* $\ldots$
\lstinline[language = XML]*</header>* tags and describes the content of each column in the data section. An example of the header is presented in \ref{header_det}.

\begin{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[language = XML]
<header>
<field column="1" name="ElapsedTime" statistic="value"/>
<field column="2" name="dt" statistic="value"/>
<field column="3" name="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000001" statistic="position" 
     components="3"/>
<field column="6" name="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000002" statistic="position" 
     components="3"/>
<field column="9" name="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000003" statistic="position" 
     components="3"/>
...
<field column="819348" name="Temperature" 
    statistic="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000001" material_phase="BoussinesqFluid"/>
<field column="819349" name="Temperature" 
    statistic="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000002" material_phase="BoussinesqFluid"/>
<field column="819350" name="Temperature" 
    statistic="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000003" material_phase="BoussinesqFluid"/>
...
<field column="983217" name="Velocity" statistic="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000001" 
    material_phase="BoussinesqFluid" components="3"/>
<field column="983220" name="Velocity" statistic="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000002" 
    material_phase="BoussinesqFluid" components="3"/>
<field column="983223" name="Velocity" statistic="LAGRANGIAN_DET_000003" 
    material_phase="BoussinesqFluid" components="3"/>
\end{lstlisting}

\caption{An example of the header in .detectors file}
\label{header_det}
\end{example}

when having the \option{/io/detectors/binary\_output} option set in Diamond, the header is stored in a plain text file with the .detectors extension and the data is stored in binary in another file with .detectors.dat extension.

In order to read the .detectors files in python, the \lstinline[language = Python]*fluidity_tools* python module described in \ref{sect:diagnostics_stat_parser} should be used.

\begin{lstlisting}[language = Python]
import fluidity_tools
detectors = fluidity_tools.stat_parser(filename)
\end{lstlisting}

As indicated earlier, this python module reads both
plain text and binary file formats. For .detectors files using the binary
format, \lstinline[language = Python]*filename* should also correspond to the XML header file.

It is possible to find out which fields are contained in a state Water with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
stat["Water"].keys()
\end{lstlisting}

The Temperature versus time for a particular detector can be plotted with the following python lines:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from matplotlib import pylab
time = detectors["ElapsedTime"]["value"]
Temp = detectors["Water"]["Temperature"]["LAGRANGIAN_DET_000001"]
pylab.plot(time, Temp)
pylab.xlabel("Time")
pylab.ylabel("Temperature")
pylab.show()
\end{lstlisting}
