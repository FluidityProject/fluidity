  /* Adapted from the NetCDF CF-convention
     In order to calculate a new date and time given a base date, base
     time and a time increment one must know what calendar to use. For
     this purpose NetCDF CF-conventions recommend that the calendar be
     specified by the NetCDF attribute calendar which is assigned to
     the time coordinate variable. The values currently defined for
     calendar are:

     gregorian or standard: Mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar as defined
     by Udunits. This is the default.

     proleptic_gregorian: A Gregorian calendar extended to dates
     before 1582-10-15. That is, a year is a leap year if either (i)
     it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 or (ii) it is divisible by
     400.

     noleap or 365_day: Gregorian calendar without leap years, i.e.,
     all years are 365 days long.

     all_leap or 366_day: Gregorian calendar with every year being a
     leap year, i.e., all years are 366 days long.

     360_day: All years are 360 days divided into 30 day months.

     julian: Julian calendar.

     none: No calendar.

     The calendar attribute may be set to none in climate experiments
     that simulate a fixed time of year. The time of year is indicated
     by the date in the reference time of the units attribute. The
     time coordinate that might apply in a perpetual July experiment
     are given in the following example.

     Example 4.5. Perpetual time axis

variables:
  double time(time) ;
    time:long_name = "time" ;
    time:units = "days since 1-7-15 0:0:0" ;
    time:calendar = "none" ;
data:
  time = 0., 1., 2., ...;



     Here, all days simulate the conditions of 15th July, so it does
     not make sense to give them different dates. The time coordinates
     are interpreted as 0, 1, 2, etc. days since the start of the
     experiment.

     If none of the calendars defined above applies (e.g., calendars
     appropriate to a different paleoclimate era), a non-standard
     calendar can be defined. The lengths of each month are explicitly
     defined with the month_lengths attribute of the time axis:

     month_lengths: A vector of size 12, specifying the number of days
     in the months from January to December (in a non-leap year).

     leap_year: If leap years are included, then two other attributes
     of the time axis should also be defined:

     leap_month: An example of a leap year. It is assumed that all
     years that differ from this year by a multiple of four are also
     leap years. If this attribute is absent, it is assumed there are
     no leap years.


     A value in the range 1-12, specifying which month is lengthened
     by a day in leap years (1=January). If this attribute is not
     present, February (2) is assumed. This attribute is ignored if
     leap_year is not specified.

     The calendar attribute is not required when a non-standard
     calendar is being used. It is sufficient to define the calendar
     using the month_lengths attribute, along with leap_year, and
     leap_month as appropriate. However, the calendar attribute is
     allowed to take non-standard values and in that case defining the
     non-standard calendar using the appropriate attributes is
     required.

Example 4.6. Paleoclimate time axis

double time(time) ;
  time:long_name = "time" ;
  time:units = "days since 1-1-1 0:0:0" ;
  time:calendar = "126 kyr B.P." ;
  time:month_lengths = 34, 31, 32, 30, 29, 27, 28, 28, 28, 32, 32, 34 ;

     The mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar used by Udunits is explained
     in the following excerpt from the udunits(3) man page:

     The udunits(3) package uses a mixed Gregorian/Julian  calen-
     dar  system.   Dates  prior to 1582-10-15 are assumed to use
     the Julian calendar, which was introduced by  Julius  Caesar
     in 46 BCE and is based on a year that is exactly 365.25 days
     long.  Dates on and after 1582-10-15 are assumed to use  the
     Gregorian calendar, which was introduced on that date and is
     based on a year that is exactly 365.2425 days long.  (A year
     is  actually  approximately 365.242198781 days long.)  Seem-
     ingly strange behavior of the udunits(3) package can  result
     if  a user-given time interval includes the changeover date.
     For example, utCalendar() and utInvCalendar() can be used to
     show that 1582-10-15 *preceded* 1582-10-14 by 9 days.


     Due to problems caused by the discontinuity in the default mixed
     Gregorian/Julian calendar, we strongly recommend that this
     calendar should only be used when the time coordinate does not
     cross the discontinuity. For time coordinates that do cross the
     discontinuity the proleptic_gregorian calendar should be used
     instead.
